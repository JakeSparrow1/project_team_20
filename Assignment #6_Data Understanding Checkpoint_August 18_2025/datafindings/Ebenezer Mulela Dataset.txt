dc.description.abstract	To determine the effect Kigelia africana fruit extract has on blood glucose levels of diabetes mice and its phytochemical profile Mice were induced with diabetes using Alloxan monohydrate 90mg/kg. Blood glucose was checked before induction and 72 hours after induction to confirm diabetes. Treatment involved using oral administration of Kigelia fruit extract 1000mg/kg, Kigelia fruit extract 500mg/kg, Glibenclamide 0.25 mg/kg, Kigelia fruit extract 500mg/kg and Glibenclamide 0.25mg/kg and Normal Saline.The results showed a greater reduction in blood glucose of mice after treatment with Kigelia extract 1000mg/kg compared to Kigelia 500mg/kg [(5.3 +/- 0.5mmol/l) vs (6.3+/- 0.6mmol/l), (p= 0.005)]. Further, Glibenclamide 0.25mg/kg showed less reduction in blood glucose than Kigelia 1000mg/kg [(7.4+/-0.9mmol/l) vs (5.3 +/- 0.5), (p= 0.00)]. The mean blood glucose levels were lower in mice that received Kigelia extract than those that received both Kigelia extract and Glibenclamide [(5.3 +/- 0.5mmol/l) vs (7.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/l), (p=0.00)]. The fruit extract tested positive for Tannins, Saponins, Flavanoids, Alkaloids, Glycosides and Steroids. Findings of this study indicate that Kigelia africana fruit extract causes reduction in blood glucose of diabetes induced mice and gives better results when used alone than in concomitant use with Glibenclamide. The study also indicates that the fruit extract has alkaloids, saponins, steroids, glycosides, tannins and flavonoids.

dc.description.abstract	Indigenous knowledge systems and traditional technologies have made and can continue to make a significant contribution to modern medicines with discovery of novel molecules in the treatment of various conditions. The traditional knowledge in our communities is passed on from generation to generation. Scientific evaluation of these compounds from traditional medicines can lead to discovery drugs with better efficacy and novel mechanism. The study aimed at determining the indigenous knowledge based preparations used for hypertension in Lusaka, Zambia. The specific objectives were: a). To determine the knowledge and practice of Traditional Health Practitioners in the management of HTN, b). To identify the parts of the plants utilized in the preparation of the IKS-based preparation used in the management of hypertension. c). To determine the procedure employed in preparing the IKS-based preparations used in the management of hypertension. d). To recommend for further elucidation of the possible active compounds in the indigenous based preparations and postulate possible pharmacological mechanisms of actions. The study adopted structured interviews complemented by non-participatory observations. Samples used by traditional healers were collected for identification and characterization A total of twelve (12) traditional healers registered with Traditional Health Practitioners of Zambia who manage hypertension were interviewed. The traditional healers interviewed had knowledge of causes of hypertension, only three (3) indicated bewitchment as one of the causes. spiritual method constituted an important method of diagnosis. The beliefs of Traditional Healers with regard to hypertension indicates their alignment to agreeing the scientific understanding of hypertension in terms of its causes, risk factors and complications. Traditional Healers in Zambia believe hypertension can be managed by some mode of action of the herbs. Common themes that emerged to determine the effectiveness of the herbs used included; patient feedback, physical appearance, confirmation at local clinic and increased urine output. Majority (5/12) felt that there herbs take atleast 7-14 before the effects are seen. All the traditional healers indicated using atleast two (2) types of herbal preparations to manage hypertension. Of the preparations mentioned three (3) were not of plant origin. These include; crocodile fat, pebble and honey. This study observed that the traditional healers of Zambia knowledge of causes and complications of hypertension are alligned to the scientific knowledge. Divination is however still the most important (50%) method used for diagnosis and witchcraft/ spiritual method forms an important method for some for diagnosis of hypertension. It is noteworthy that traditional healers in Zambia believe hypertension can be managed by some mode of action of the herbs a belief shared by the conventional management.	en

dc.description.abstract	Opuntia stricta (commonly called prickly pear cactus) is a natural plant that grows in some parts of Zambia where its fruits and cladodes are commonly consumed for nutritional and medicinal purposes, including glycaemic control among some patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). There is insufficient evidence whether Opuntia stricta indigenously growing in Zambia possess antidiabetic effects.To assess in vivo antidiabetic effects of the aqueous extract of Opuntia stricta cladodes in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. A laboratory-based experimental study was conducted involving 20 adult Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) weighing 18-30 g. DM was induced using a single intraperitoneal dose of alloxan monohydrate 90 mg/kg. Opuntia stricta aqueous extract was administered orally and blood glucose levels (in mmol/L) monitored daily for 10 days. Alloxan induced a 4- to 5-fold sustained increase in blood glucose levels at 72 hours after administration in mice. Within a 10-day experimental period, Opuntia stricta cladode aqueous extract (1 mg/kg) significantly reduced blood glucose levels in vivo (from 16.6 ± 1.4 mmol/L, 95% CI: 14.9-18.3 at baseline to 7.5 ± 1.0 mmol/L, 95% CI: 6.2-8.9 at endpoint, p < 0.001, n = 5). Similarly, at a dose of 2 mg/kg, the extract significantly reduced blood glucose levels (from 18.7 ± 4.6 mmol/L, 95% CI: 13.0-24.4 at baseline to 6.9 ± 1.7 mmol/L, 95% CI: 4.7-9.0 at endpoint, p = 0.001, n = 5). Opuntia stricta cladode aqueous extract attained a greater reduction in blood glucose levels compared to Glibenclamide 0.25 mg/kg. Opuntia stricta cladode aqueous extract demonstrated a presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, carbohydrates, phenols and tannins. Opuntia stricta cladode from Zambia demonstrates antidiabetic effects to reduce blood glucose levels in vivo.	en

dc.description.abstract	The bark root of Steganotaenia araliacea Hochst (Umbelliferae) nicknamed “herbal pitocin” is used in the traditional circles in Zambia to induce and/or enhance labour. This work was aimed at investigating the contractile stimulatory effects of the aqueous extracts of Steganotaenia araliacea (SAEª) on isolated smooth muscle preparations of the rat uterus. Objectives: To determine the physiological effect of SAEª on isolated pregnant and non-pregnant uterine muscle. Methods: A gravid/non-gravid rat was sacrificed by cervical dislocation (decapitation) method and the abdomen opened to expose the internal organs. The two uterine horns were identified, dissected out and transferred to a dish containing De Jalon’s physiological solution. Acetylcholine (Ach) and Oxytocin (OT) were used as reference agonist with their corresponding antagonists; atropine (AT), and indomethacin and salbutamol (SBM) respectively. The effect of these reference agonists with their corresponding antagonist and that of aqueous extract of SAE on non-pregnant rat uterus pre-treated with 1 mg/kg stilboesterol for 24 h and on the pregnant rat uterus were investigated. Results: In vitro studies of SAEª on uterine tissue showed contractile (uterotonic) activity on both isolated gravid and estrogenized non-gravid rat uterus at the concentration shown in this study. SAE ª significantly increased the amplitude(from baseline value of 0.1471mN to 0.3003mN) and frequency of spontaneous uterine contractions. However, SBM significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous uterine contractions on the isolated pregnant and non – pregnant rat uterus preparations but atropine and indomethacin could not modify the contractions produced by SAEª, hence indicating a non-muscarinic and non-prostaglandin biosynthesis dependant respectively. Conclusion: The inhibition of contractile effect of the crude aqueous extract of SAEª shown by Salbutamol (p < 0.05) suggests the probable stimulation of the Oxytocinergic receptors of the uterus by the extract. These physiological finding justify the traditional use of the plant for its uterotonic properties.	en

dc.description.abstract	The root of Steganotaenia araliacea is used for assisting labour in folk medicine. Recent reports indicate that the root could possess uterotonic substances.The study aimed to evaluate three methods for the extraction of uterotonic principles from the root of S. araliacea growing in Zambia. Roots of the plant were collected from Chongwe District of Zambia. The air-dried roots were size-reduced, and the powdered material extracted with hot ethanol, hot distilled water, and cold distilled water. The solvent extracts were concentrated and dried at 110 0C. Solutions of the hot aqueous and cold aqueous extracts were prepared in distilled water and used for organ bath experiments to demonstrate uterotonic activities using strips of pregnant rat uterus. The frequencies and amplitude of contractile forces were recorded. The amplitudes were plotted against log concentration of extract with GraphPad Prism software, and the EC50 values determined. The percentage yields were 31.3 % for the hot aqueous extract, 8.15 % for the ethanolic extract, and 3.27 % for the cold aqueous extract. The cold aqueous extract showed higher potency (EC50 of 0.54 mg/ml) compared to the hot aqueous extract (EC50 of 2.09 mg/ml). Root extracts of S. araliacea possess demonstrable uterotonic effects. Extraction of the roots for this purpose could benefit from preliminary defatting with organic solvents, followed by successive extraction with hot and cold water.	en
