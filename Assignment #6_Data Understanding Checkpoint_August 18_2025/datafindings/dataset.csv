Munsaka, Soddy Mweetwa; Ndhlovu, Jacob,2018,"Vitamin B12 and Folate deficiency in Megaloblastic Anaemia diagnosed morphologically at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia","The International Journal of Multi-Disciplinary Research","Megaloblastic anaemia; pancytopenia; Vitamin B12 deficiency","Background: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is a well-known health problem world-wide. Deficiencies of folic acid and vitamin B12 are known to cause megaloblastic anaemia, which is characterised by presence of abnormally large erythrocyte precursor cells, megaloblasts, in the bone marrow and macrocytic red cells in the peripheral blood. These megaloblasts arise because of impaired DNA synthesis followed by ineffective erythropoiesis. However, vitamin B12 or folate levels have not been described in Zambia, whether normal levels or in relation to anaemia. The study aimed to determine vitamin B12 and folate levels in megaloblastic anaemia, diagnosed morphologically, in patients at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka. Methods: Cross-sectional study with FBC, smears and ELISA on megaloblastic anaemia and non-anaemic patients. Results: 40 patients, 35% male, 65% female, mean age 31. Bicytopenia in 22.5% and pancytopenia in 72.5%. Lower B12 and folate in anaemic patients. 60% had B12 deficiency, 30% pure folate deficiency, 15% combined. Conclusion: Majority of megaloblastic anaemia patients had B12 deficiency, implicating B12 and folate in disease process.","Article","http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/5330"
Prashar, Lavina; Lukubi, Lwindi; Goma, Fastone; Mushabati, Festus; Choongo, Kennedy,2015,"Physiological response of uterine muscle to Steganoteania araliacea in rat models","RA Publications","Steganotaenia araliacea; uterine; Oxytocin; Atropine","The bark root of Steganotaenia araliacea (Umbelliferae), nicknamed “herbal pitocin”, is used in traditional circles in Zambia to induce/enhance labour. This work investigated the contractile stimulatory effects of aqueous extracts of Steganotaenia araliacea (SAE) on isolated smooth muscle preparations of rat uterus. Methods: Isolated uterine muscle from gravid/non-gravid rats, tested with reference agonists/antagonists. Results: SAE showed contractile (uterotonic) activity on uterine tissue, increased amplitude and frequency of contractions. Salbutamol inhibited this effect, but atropine/indomethacin did not, suggesting non-muscarinic and non-prostaglandin biosynthesis dependence. Conclusion: SAE likely stimulates oxytocinergic receptors, justifying traditional uterotonic use.","Article","http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/5479"

This study aimed to determine indigenous knowledge-based preparations for hypertension in Lusaka, Zambia. Twelve traditional healers managing hypertension were interviewed. Most healers were knowledgeable about causes/complications of hypertension and used herbal remedies with patient feedback and clinical confirmation as effectiveness indicators. Some remedies included non-plant origin substances. Divination/spiritual diagnosis was important. Healers' beliefs align with scientific management. Conclusion: Traditional healers in Zambia have knowledge aligned to science and use herbal remedies for hypertension management.","Article","http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/5494"
Prashar, Lavina; Muyenga, Tumelo; Bwalya, Angela Gono; Muungo, L.T.M,2015,"The Effect of Kigelia africana Fruit Extract on Blood Glucose in Diabetes Induced Mice","RA Publications","Alloxan monohydrate; antidiabetic; Kigelia africana fruit extract","This study determined the effect of Kigelia africana fruit extract on blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and its phytochemical profile. Mice induced with diabetes using alloxan; treated with various doses of Kigelia extract and glibenclamide. Results: Kigelia extract 1000mg/kg led to greater reduction in blood glucose than 500mg/kg or glibenclamide. Combination of extract and glibenclamide showed less effect than extract alone. Phytochemical tests showed tannins, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids. Conclusion: Kigelia africana fruit extract reduces blood glucose in diabetic mice, more effective alone than with glibenclamide.","Article","http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/5482"
Banda, S. S.,2007,"Determining how the knowledge of anatomy may Influence success or failure in clinical practice","Medical Journal of Zambia","Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Anatomy; Knowledge","Doctors' clinical experience was used to investigate how anatomical knowledge influenced success/failure in clinical encounters. Doctors described specific successful and unsuccessful encounters attributed to anatomical knowledge or its lack. Themes identified: ability to locate anatomical structures, interpret images, assess patients, evaluate anomalies, interpret lab reports. Results can inform clinically oriented anatomy curricula. Demonstrates qualitative research in clinical practice.","Article","http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/5833"

The operation modifies the knee joint angle to lock it early during stance, allowing walking with minimal muscle power. The optimal recurvation angle depends on muscle strength, particularly gluteus maximus and triceps. The study attempts to establish objective criteria for determining the recurvation angle biomechanically.","Article","http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/5817"
