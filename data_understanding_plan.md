# Data Understanding Plan - Chibwanta Mukonka

## UNZA Repository Research
**Repository URL**: https://dspace.unza.zm/
**Platform**: DSpace digital repository system
**Content**: ETDs (Electronic Theses and Dissertations)
**Current Status**: Active repository with recent 2024-2025 submissions

## Initial Findings from Repository Browse
**Recent ETDs Found**:
- School of Education (curriculum studies, teaching methodologies, agricultural education)
- School of Humanities and Social Sciences (linguistics, history, religious studies)  
- Graduate research across multiple departments
- Cross-disciplinary and regional studies
- Public health and nutrition research

**Document Format**: PDF files with full text available
**Access Level**: Open access for recent submissions, mixed access for older documents
**Date Range**: Active submissions from 2024-2025, with archive going back several years
**Content Quality**: Well-structured academic documents with comprehensive reference sections

## Data Collection Strategy
**Phase 1**: Collect 20-30 sample ETDs for pilot testing
**Phase 2**: Collect 100-150 ETDs for model training
**Sampling Method**: Stratified sampling across schools and degree levels
**Reference Extraction**: Target bibliography/reference sections (typically 50-200 refs per ETD)
**Expected References**: 5,000-10,000 total references for analysis

## Reference Format Patterns Observed
**Common Citation Styles**:
- APA format (most education and social science theses)
- Harvard referencing system
- Mixed formats within some documents
- International and local journal citations

**Typical Reference Examples**:
- Journal articles: "Author, A. (Year). Title. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), pages."
- Books: "Author, A. (Year). Book Title. Publisher."
- Theses: "Author, A. (Year). Thesis title. Institution."
- Local sources: Mix of Zambian and international references

## Data Quality Assessment Plan
**Quality Indicators to Check**:
- Reference section completeness
- Author name consistency
- Affiliation information availability
- Citation format standardization
- PDF text extraction accuracy

**Potential Challenges Identified**:
- Scanned vs. text-based PDFs
- Multiple citation formats
- Abbreviated vs. full author names
- Missing or incomplete affiliation data
- Special characters and formatting issues
