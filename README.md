## 1. Business Understanding  

### Problem Statement  
The University of Zambia wants to quickly identify research authored by its staff in the institutional repository.  
Manually verifying affiliations is **slow and error-prone**.  
We aim to build a **predictive model** that classifies whether an ETD document was authored by UNZA staff, based on metadata and content.
